Astro::FITS::CFITSIO requires CFITSIO library version 4.3.0 or later.

You do not need to install CFITSIO yourself.  Astro::FITS::CFITSIO
uses the Alien::CFITSIO module (avaliable on CPAN) to locate or
install the CFITSIO library.

Installation of Alien::CFITSIO ensures that CFITSIO is available,
either by locating a locally installed version, or by automatically
downloading and installing CFITSIO into a location private to
Perl modules (it won't contaminate your environment).

Installation Via A CPAN Client:
-------------------------------

Install as you would any other module, e.g.

   $cpan Astro::FITS::CFITSIO

where $cpan may be cpan, cpanm, or cpm.

Manual Installation:
--------------------

1. Install Alien::CFITSIO from CPAN. 

2. perl Makefile.PL

3. make

4. make test

5. If you want, compare the output of the testprog/testprog*.pl
   scripts to cfitsio's testprog.c. There is a small shell script -
   "runtests" - included to make this easier.

6. make install
